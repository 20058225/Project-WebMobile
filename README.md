to build a website that allows the user to view all the properties for sale rentals. Clicking on
any of the property should take you to an individual property page for detailed information
including but not limited to (the energy ratings, the price, the details, features of the
property, all media both images and videos available for the property). Once the user has
found a property they are interested in they should be able to book a viewing by using a
simple reservation form JS only no backend required. A JSON file will be provided to use for
this CA in the next week.

You should ensure the website is mobile friendly and can be viewed on a wide range of
devices. You should also build simple search bar that allows you to find the property from a
list of properties.
